/*!
  The following is the model for the experiment configuration for VESPERS.  It handles enabling some of the key components that users need to worry about when setting up
  an experiment.  Like many other classes, the ability to set an experiment configuration can be done directly or using actions.

  For VESPERS, the synchronized dwell time, the sample stage, and both vortex detectors are required and therefore passed into the constructor.  The other controls are created internally in this class.
