/// One good way for components in the Acquaman framework to access and set a variety of beamline controls is through a centralized AMBeamline object.  This class provides the basic functionality expected of every beamline, and can be subclassed to include the specific controls available on a particular machine.  It uses the singleton design pattern to ensure that only a single instance of the beamline object exists; you can access this object through AMBeamline::bl().

/*! <b>Note on subclassing and inheritance</b>
  Singleton classes are designed so that only a single instance of the object can be created.  This is accomplished by making the constructor private (or protected), and always accessing the object through a static member function (in this case, AMBeamline::bl()).

  This static function first checks to see if an instance of the object has already been created. If it hasn't, it creates a new instance, stores it in the static instance_ variable, and then returns it. In other cases, bl() simply returns the existing instance.

  When you subclass AMBeamline, it's important to provide your own accessor function, for example:
\code
static YOURBeamline* bl() {
	if(!instance_)
		instance_ = new YOURBeamline();
	return static_cast<YOURBeamline*>(instance_);
}
\endcode
which sets AMBeamline's protected instance_ variable.

As long as the FIRST call to use the beamline is through YOURBeamline::bl(), then all successive calls to AMBeamline::bl() will return the instance of your specific beamline.  If anything calls AMBeamline::bl() before this, there will be no instance_ yet, and it will return 0.  Therefore, it's necessary to call YOURBeamline::bl() to initialize the beamline object before any other code might access AMBeamline; we would normally place this intialization inside your specific version of AMAppController::startup().
