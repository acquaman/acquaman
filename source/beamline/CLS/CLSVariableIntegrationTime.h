/*!
  The following is meant to be an abstraction to the Variable Integration time app used at the CLS.  Currently, only knowledge of how it works is based on
  VESPERS, however my understanding is that all of the apps were made by the same person (Ru) and therefore will likely be very similar, if not identical,
  to each other in naming conventions and other aspects.  To use the class, the idea will be to pass the base name and the constructor will build the
  necessary controls.  The functionality of the class will be similar to the new trend for AM classes to have getters, setters, and action getters.  Getters
  and setters for immediate actions on the beamline, and action getters that return an AMBeamlineActionItem that handles all the necessary setup and can be
  started at any time and behave according the Acquaman actions framework (useful for intialization or clean up procedures that need to wait for other actions
  to complete before starting).  One final thing, although most things use seconds as the default unit of time, the CLS app uses milliseconds.  Therefore,
  I have mapped all of the values from milliseconds to seconds for consistency within AM.
