/*!
  This class encapuslats the SR570's that are used at the CLS for gain sensitivity control.  They have the ability for
  setting the value and units to a reasonably high level.  It allows customizability in value: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100,
  200, and 500, and in units: pA/V, nA/V, uA/V, mA/V.

  As an implementation detail, the implementation always uses two PVs; one for the value and one for the units.
