/// This class is a subclass of AMPVwStatusControl that is useful for IMS MDrive motors at the CLS using the initial version of the driver that doesn't support unit conversion. (Future versions of that driver will have unit conversion built-in, and this class can switch to using AMPVwStatusControl instead of AMPVwStatusAndUnitConversionControl.

public:
	/// Constructor
	/*!
	  \param name A unique representative name for this motor
	  \param basePVName The base of the PV name (ie: if the motor status was "SMTR16114I1022:status" then the base is "SMTR16114I1022")
	  \param units The name of the units that describe positions for this motor
	  \param unitsPerRev The scale factor used to convert from motor revolutions to desired units (ie: units/rev).  value() = step position / (200*microsteps steps/rev) * unitsPerRev + offset.  value() = encoder position / (4000 lines/rev) * unitsPerRev + offset.
	  \param offset The offset used in the conversion from motor revolutions to desired units (in desired units).  value() = step position / (200*microsteps steps/rev) * unitsPerRev + offset.  value() = encoder position / (4000 lines/rev) * unitsPerRev + offset.
	  \param microsteps The microstep setting for the motor. We need to know this because the step position depends on the microstep setting, but the encoder feedback is always in 4000 lines/rev.
	  \param description A human readable description for this motor
	  \param tolerance The tolerance that will be used to determine if moves succeed in getting close enough to be considered a success. It should be specified in our desired units.
	  \param moveStartTimeout How long the motor has to start moving before something is considered wrong
	  \param parent QObject parent class

	  Implementation note: We need to use separate readUnitConverters and writeUnitConverters, since the feedback PV (readPV) is in encoder counts at 4000lines/rev, and the move PV (writePV) is in steps (ie: 200*microsteps/rev).

	/*! A "null move" is a move to the current position (or something very very close to it).  Some controls may not change their move status on a null move; in this case, the move would appear to fail, even though the control "reached" its target. This provides an optional work-around: if moveStartTolerance() is non-zero, and the current feedback value() is within moveStartTolerance() of the setpoint, a move() command will start and succeed immediately without any physical motion.  Note that the hardware is NOT told to move in this mode. (It if was, any move status change might be interpreted as the end of a subsequent move.)

	By default, moveStartTolerance_ is 0 and has no effect.
