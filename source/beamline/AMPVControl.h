This class measures values using a single Process Variable.  It cannot be used to set values.  An example usage would be measuring the storage ring current.  There is no way to decide whether the control is "moving" or not (How do you define if the ring current is "moving"?), so this behavior is undefined.

The unique behavior is defined as:

/*!
The AMControl interface should be inherited to implement real-world control devices.  The exact meaning of the properties might change depending on the physical device and its capabilities.  As a useful example, we've provided a set of real controls with different levels of capability that implement Epics Process-Variable type connections.

This class measures values using one Process Variable, and writes out a setpoint using another.  An example usage would be setting and monitoring a high-voltage bias power supply.  There is no explicit way to decide whether the control is "moving" or not, so we define it like this:

- isConnected means:		the feedback process variable AND the setpoint process variable are connected.
- isMoving() means:			a move() has been issued, the completionTimeout() hasn't occurred, and the value hasn't entered tolerance. same as moveInProgress()
- moveSucceeded() means:	after a move() has been issued, the value entered tolerance before the completionTimeout() occurred
- moveFailed() means:		after starting a move, the completionTimeout() occurred before the value reached tolerance

Since we don't have a way to determine if the control is actually moving, this class introduces a completionTimeout(). If the value doesn't reach within tolerance() of setpoint() within a certain time, the move will fail.  One limitation is that if the control overshoots the setpoint, we can't tell the difference between this, and a successful move that rises later.  See AMPVwStatusControl for more sophisticated move completion testing.

For these to make sense, make sure to use intelligent values for the tolerance and the timeout.  The default (AMCONTROL_TOLERANCE_DONT_CARE) will result in moves completing right away, regardless of where they get to.

Because we don't have a great idea of whether this control is actually moving or not, we set the default allowsMovesWhileMoving() to true... To make sure we never omit sending moves we actually should have, because we think we're moving.  Call setAllowsMovesWhileMoving(false) if your device does not support receiving move() commands while it's already in motion.

As a useful example, we've provided a set of real controls with different levels of capability that implement Epics Process-Variable type connections.

This class measures values using one Process Variable (PV), and moves them to setpoints using a second PV.  It also watches third Process Variable to see if the control is moving.  An example usage would be controlling the "beamline energy" PV that is common on most beamlines.  Most importantly, it adds a working move() instruction, and reports shouldMove() = true.

isMoving() has the same meaning as for AMReadOnlyPVwStatusControl.  However, this class adds the moveInProgress() property to indicate of one of \em your moves -- a move triggered by this software -- is executing, as well as the moveStarted, moveSucceeded, and moveFailed(explanation) signals that accompany changes of moveInProgress().

Because we can monitor the moving status, it's possible to detect a situation where a stubborn device didn't respond to even our most polite move() instruction.  The moveStartTimeout() lets you set a time period withing which the device must start isMoving() after a move() instruction.  Failure to do so results in a moveFailed() signal.


The unique behavior is defined as:

- isConnected means:		the feedback process variable, setpoint PV, and moving-status PV are connected.
- isMoving() means:		(moving-status PV's current value & isMovingMask) == isMovingValue

- moveSucceeded() means:	after a move(), the isMoving() went back to stopped, and the value() was within tolerance() of setpoint()
- moveFailed() means:		after a move(), either
  -isMoving() did not start within moveStartTimeout(), or
  - when isMoving() went back to stopped, the required tolerance was not met.

	/*! EPICS channel access provides no guarantee on the order in which channel access monitors from different PVs are received. Therefore, it's highly likely that the status PV may receive the "Move Done" notification before the latest feedback value() is received from the read PV.  This can cause two problems: (1) depending on the tolerance and the monitoring rate, a physically-successful move may incorrectly report a tolerance failure, because the within-tolerance feedback value has not yet been received by the end of a move, and (2) the feedback value() read immediately after a move finishes may not actually be accurate. [In both cases, the true feedback value will probably be arriving a few ms later].

	  If a settling time is specified, the control will wait for that many seconds before checking the tolerance and reporting either moveFailed() or moveSucceeded(), as well as changing isMoving() and moveInProgress().

	  The default settling time is currently 0 [disabled].

/// This class provides an AMControl with measure-only capability, based on an Epics Process Variable Waveform implementation.
/*!
The AMControl interface should be inherited to implement real-world control devices.  The exact meaning of the properties might change depending on the physical device and its capabilities.  As a useful example, we've provided a set of real controls with different levels of capability that implement Epics Process-Variable type connections.

This class measures values using a single Process Variable Waveform. This subclass can bin a waveform's values into a single value.  It cannot be used to set values.  An example usage would be measuring a spectral detector. The waveform represents each bin individually, but the ability to bin regions of interest is useful.  There is no way to decide whether the control is "moving" or not (How do you define if the ring current is "moving"?), so this behavior is undefined.

The unique behavior is defined as:

<table>
<tr><td>isConnected means:		<td>the feedback process variable is connected.
<tr><td>isMoving() means:		<td>[always false; no good way to determine this]
<tr><td>moveSucceeded() means:	<td>[never happens]
<tr><td>moveFailed() means:		<td>[happens on any attempted move; can't do that!]
</table>

Most useful members for using this class:

- value()
- name()
- setBinParameters(int, int)
- isConnected()
- valueChanged()
