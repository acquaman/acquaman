/*! This class is used to set PVs based on either an AMROIInfo class or through other means (ex: a detector view).  It is meant to encapsulate the different pieces of an ROI into a single class.  For instance, the energy, the low limit, the high limit, and the name are all useful to group together.

  \todo This class is not implementation independent.  Because there does not exist an AMControl that handles arbitrary QStrings, I have chosen to implement the entire thing using PVs. Once the AMControl class can handle all things required by this class I will port it over to AMControls and AMControlSets.
