/// An AMControlSet is designed to hold a logical group of controls.
/*!
  Internally, AMControl provides a way of organizing controls hierarchichally, using its childrenControls().  This relationship implies ownership and exclusivity. On the other hand, AMControlSet provides a way of organizing controls that are logically linked together.
  For example, beamline energy might be related to several other controls (say mono angle, undulator gap, and exit slit position).
  These are heirarchically linked, so should be children of an energy AMControl.
  This way you could monitor the status of each child to get the status of the control as a whole.
  Conversely, the expected flux of the beamline at any given energy may be several parameters (say the mono grating choice, the exit slit gap, and the harmonic).
  These are logically linked, and should be in an AMControlSet. The convenience is that a large control object can list its logical groups, which can be displayed together or operated on as a group.
  As well, heirarchically linked controls should not likely wind up as a child of more than one control; however, logically grouped controls have no real problem overlapping.

  AMControlSet provides a container for a logical group of controls.  The container does NOT take ownership of the controls that are placed in it, nor delete these controls when removing from the container or deleting the container.
