/// An AMControl is an abstract representation of all basic scientific quantities that can be adjusted (controlled) or measured.
/*!

  Fundamentally, a Control can be "measured" and/or "moved".  All controls have the following abilities:

  \b actions:

  - FailureExplanation move(double setpoint): set a Control to a requested target value. Returns a FailureExplanation if the move() cannot be accepted for any reason [ex: control not connected, a move is already in progress and allowsMovesWhileMoving() is false, etc.].  Returns NoFailure (0) on success.

  \b properties:

  - double value(): the readout/value/position at this instant in time
  - QString name(): A descriptive (and hopefully unique) name for this Control

  - isConnected(): indicates that the control is hooked up and operating correctly; ready for use.
  - signal: connected(bool isConnected): emitted for changes in isConnected()

  - bool shouldMeasure(): this control should be capable of reporting it's current value, assuming that it's connected.
  - bool shouldMove(): this control should be capable of being adjusted, assuming that it's connected.
  - bool canMeasure(), canMove(): indicate that, at this instant in time, the control is capable of being measured or moved

  - QPair<double, double> range()
  - double minimumValue():
  - double maximumValue(): the limits of this control's range

  - double setpoint(): For Controls that can be moved, this is the most recently requested target (desired value)
  - double tolerance(): This "deadband" or "epsilon" represents how close a AMControl must get to it's target value for it to count as inPosition() (or for the move to have succeeded).  It represents the level of accuracy the scientist requires for this quantity; ie: the maximum acceptable error between value() and setpoint().  The default value is CONTROL_TOLERANCE_DONT_CARE -- a very large number.  Use setTolerance() to change it.
  - bool inPosition(): indicates the AMControl is within tolerance() of it's requested target.
  - bool withinTolerance(double target): indicates the AMControl is within tolerance() of a specified target

  <b>Monitoring Motion</b>

  There are two useful but distinct ideas on whether a control is "moving", particularly for distributed control systems.  Often, beamline parameters can be controlled from a user's software interface, but they can also spontaneously start moving due to external events or other control interfaces.

One concept of moving simply reflects what you would see in the physical world: is the value of the Control currently changing? (either triggered by the user, or by external inputs)
In other cases, what you really want to know is whether the Control started or stopped moving <em>in response to your instructions</em>.  This is useful when scanning a value, and wanting to receive confirmation that the Control is doing what you told it to.

The Control abstraction provides two different properties (and associated signals) for these two concepts. The first one simply indicates motion, regardless of the cause:

  - bool isMoving(): indicates that the Control's measurement is transient / on its way toward a steady-state value.
  - signal: movingChanged(bool isMoving): provides notification of changes in isMoving()
  - signal: valueChanged(double newValue): emits a signal whenever a new sample (measured value) is obtained.

The second category only reflects motion due to instructions sent by \em this software:

  - bool moveInProgress(): A move that you requested is currently happening
  - signal: moveStarted(): emitted when moveInProgress first goes to true
  - signal: moveSucceeded(): emitted when a move completes successfully, and the final value() is within tolerance of the setpoint.
  - signal: moveFailed(int explanation): emitted when a move is not able to complete for some reason. Possible explanation codes are:
 -# Could not start the move because the control's not connected / responding
 -# The move finished, but failed to achieve the tolerance requested
 -# The move did not complete within a timeout period specified
 -# an error code defined by the specific control implementation

<b>Re-targetting moves while already moving</b>
Some devices can accept new setpoints while in motion toward a first setpoint, while others cannot.  Use setAllowsMovesWhileMoving() to specify whether move() commands should be accepted while the device is already moving.

Defaults:
- AMControl: allowsMovesWhileMoving() == false
- AMPVControl: allowsMovesWhileMoving() == true, since we have no really reliable way to tell if these controls are actually moving.
- AMPVwStatusControl: allowsMovesWhileMoving() == false.

If moves while moving are not accepted, move() will return AlreadyMovingFailure and do nothing.  If they are accepted, moveReTargetted() will be emitted for each re-targetted move(); however, no moveSucceeded() or moveFailed() will be emitted for the initial move.  Instead, only one moveSucceeded() or moveFailed() will be emitted when motion finally stops.  This behaviour is chosen so that the moveSucceeded() or moveFailed() from the intial move would not be confused as a moveSucceeded() or moveFailed() for the subsequent moves.

<b>Normal move:</b> moveStarted().... ...[moveSucceeded() or moveFailed()]
<b>Re-targetted once:</b> moveStarted()... moveReTargetted()... ...[moveSucceeded() or moveFailed()]
<b>Re-targetted twice:</b> moveStarted()... moveReTargetted()... moveReTargetted()...[moveSucceeded() or moveFailed()]

<b>Grouping Controls</b>

One additional feature of Controls is the ability to logically group sets of sub-controls together.  (For example, a Monochromator control could consist of a Grating angle control, exit slit position control, and grating selector.)
Every Control therefore has a list of subcontrols:

\b Actions:

- void addChild(AMControl* newChild): Insert a subcontrol into this group

\b Properties:

- QList<AMControl*> children(): returns the subcontrols grouped under this control.
- int numChildren(): number of subcontrols in the group
- AMControl* child(int index): return a single subcontrol

One powerful ability of the control grouping is being able to generate a list of the current state of a tree of subcontrols, and then restoring the controls to the same state later:

- QMap<QString, double> currentState() const;
- bool setState(QMap<QString, double> namesAndValues);

\todo implement currentState()


<b> Implementing Real Controls</b>

These properties are defined as the general characteristics that all Controls are expected to have, regardless of the actual hardware or connection method. (For example, they should be equally useful for representing Process Variables in an Epics-based control system, devices connected directly via TCP-IP or serial lines, or off-site controls interfaced using smoke signals or bongo drums.)

The AMControl interface should be inherited to implement real-world control devices.  The exact meaning of the properties might change depending on the physical device and its capabilities.  As a useful example, we've provided a set of real controls with different levels of capability that implement Epics Process-Variable type connections:

<b>Example Classes</b>
<table>
<tr><td>Class Name					<td>Description
<tr><td>AMControl					<td>Interface definition. Can be instantiated, but not particularly useful.
<tr><td>AMCompositeControl			<td>Empty control that doesn't move or measure, but reports the combined moving status and connected status of its subcontrols
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVControl			<td>Measures a single process variable.  Cannot be used to set values.
<tr><td>AMPVControl					<td>Measures a feedback process variable, and moves a setpoint PV.
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVwStatusControl	<td>Measures a single process variable, and monitors a second PV for moving status
<tr><td>AMPVwStatusControl			<td>Measures a feedback PV, moves a setpoint PV, and monitors a status PV
</table>


<b>Examples of where to use these</b>
<table>
<tr><td>Class Name					<td>Usage example
<tr><td>AMControl					<td>
<tr><td>AMCompositeControl			<td>A "Beamline" group that shows whether anything on the beamline is moving or disconnected
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVControl			<td>Observing the storage ring current ("isMoving()" is hard to define here, so its meaningless)
<tr><td>AMPVControl					<td>High-voltage bias settings, with a setpoint and feedback value
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVwStatusControl	<td>Another beamline's energy motor feedback, with moving/not-moving indicators
<tr><td>AMPVwStatusControl			<td>Your beamline's energy motor setpoint and feedback
</table>

We need to carefully specify the behavior for all of these implementation-defined situations:

<b>isConnected() means:</b>

<table>
<tr><td>AMControl					<td>[is always false]
<tr><td>AMCompositeControl			<td>all children are connected
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVControl			<td>feedback PV is connected
<tr><td>AMPVControl					<td>feedback and setpoint PVs are connected
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVwStatusControl	<td>feedback and motion-status PVs are connected
<tr><td>AMPVwStatusControl			<td>feedback, setpoint, and motion-status PVs are all connected
</table>

<b>isMoving() means:</b>

<table>
<tr><td>AMControl					<td>[is always false]
<tr><td>AMCompositeControl			<td>any child is moving
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVControl			<td>[is always false: no good way to determine this]
<tr><td>AMPVControl					<td>one of your moves is executing (moveInProgress = true)
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVwStatusControl	<td>motion-status PV indicates that the control is moving
<tr><td>AMPVwStatusControl			<td>motion-status PV indicates that the control is moving
</table>

<b>moveSucceeded() means:</b>

<table>
<tr><td>AMControl					<td>[never happens]
<tr><td>AMCompositeControl			<td>[never happens]
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVControl			<td>[never happens]
<tr><td>AMPVControl					<td>after starting a move, the value() came within tolerance() of setpoint() before completionTimeout()
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVwStatusControl	<td>[never happens]
<tr><td>AMPVwStatusControl			<td>motion-status PV indicates that the control stopped moving, and the value was not within tolerance of setpoint()
</table>

<b>moveFailed() means:</b>

<table>
<tr><td>AMControl					<td>[never happens]
<tr><td>AMCompositeControl			<td>[never happens]
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVControl			<td>[never happens]
<tr><td>AMPVControl					<td>after starting a move, the completionTimeout() occured before value() came within tolerance() of setpoint()
<tr><td>AMReadOnlyPVControl			<td>[never happens]
<tr><td>AMPVwStatusControl			<td>The motion-status PV indicated that the control stopped moving, and the value was not within tolerance() of setpoint.  OR... The PV did not start isMoving() within startTimeout().
</table>
