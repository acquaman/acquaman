/// An AMDetector is an abstract representation of all scientific tools designed to report data
/*!
  As a programmer, you may wish to implement your own AMDetector subclass. Check around first! You may find that someone has already done the work.

  You will need to look into three types of calls: functions you MUST implement, functions you MAY wish to reimplement, and functions you MUST call.

  \b MUST Implement:
  - size(int) Must be implemented to ensure that you return sensible information.

  - requiresPower() Must be implemented to say whether or not the detector needs additional powering.

  - canContinuousAcquire() Must be implemented to say whether or not the detector can support continuous acquisitions.
  - canCancel() Must be implemented to say if the detector's acquisition can be cancelled.
  - canClear() Must be implemented to say if the detector's capable of clearing its current data.

  - acquisitionTime() Must be implemented to return the detector's current dwell time.
  - setAcquisitionTime() Must be implemented to change the detector's current dwell time. Return false if this cannot be set or is set incorreclty.
  - createSetAcquisitionTimeAction() Must be implemented to return an action that can set the acquisition time for triggered detectors.

  - supportsSynchronizedDwell() Must be implemented to say if the detector can be controlled by a synchronzed dwell time tool. FLESH THIS OUT.
  - currentlySynchronizedDwell() Must be implemented to say if the detector is currently being controlled by a synchronized dwell time tool. FLESH THIS OUT.

  - readMethod() Must be implemented to say how this detector reads (request/trigger, immedite, wait). While it's unlikely that your detector can change this on the fly, it is not impossible.
  - readMode() Must be implemented to say how this detector is currently reading data (single acquisition, continuous). Some detectors can switch on the fly.
  - setReadMode() Must be implemented to deal with switching on the fly. If your detector does not support this, simply return false and do nothing.

  - reading() Must be implemented to pull out single-valued readings from your detector.
  - data() Must be implemented to return a raw data pointer for fast access.

  - dataSource() Must be implemented to return an appropriate data source for viewing the detector output.

  - acquireImplementation(AMDetectorDefinitions::ReadMode) Must be implemented to start the internal acquisition process.
  - initializeImplementation() Must be implemented to internally initialize the detector. If the detector requires no initialization you can call setInitialized() and return true. If you require many steps you may consider making a list of actions to do the work.
  - cleanupImplementation() Must be implemented to internally cleanup the detector after acquisition/scans. If the detector requires no cleanup you can call setCleanedUp() and return true. If you require many steps you may consider making a list of actions to do the work.

  \b MAY Reimplement:
  - rank(), size(), axes() There are default implementations, but these are only valid for 0D detectors

  - reading0D, reading1D, reading2D There are default implementations, but they are inefficient because they will call reading() repeatedly
  - lastContinuousReadingImplementation(double*) May be implemented to return the continuous reading. Default implementation returns false. Also, lastContinuousReading() automatically checks canContinuousAcquire() and returns false if the detector doesn't support it.
  - clearImplementation() May be implemented to internally clear the current data if possible. Default implementation returns false. Also, clear() automatically checks canClear() and returns false if the detector doesn't support it.

  - createInitializationActions() A default action is created using the initialization functions and signals. If you wish to make a specific action or return a list of actions you may.
  - createCleanupActions() A default action is created using the cleanup functions and signals. If you wish to make a specific action or return a list of actions you may.

  \b MUST Call:
  - setConnected() You must call this function when your detector has connected, this way the signals are always emitted correctly.
  - setPowered() You must call this function if you detector requires some additional form of power (likely high voltage), this way signals are always emitted correctly.

  - setInitializing(), setInitialized(), setInitializationRequired() You must call these functions to change the state of the initialization state machine (read more about the initializtion state machine for further details). Since these states can change due to external events, you can call these as slots if you like. If you never require any initialization, you can call setInitialized() in your constructor.
  - setCleaningUp(), setCleanedUp(), setCleanupRequired() You must call these functions to change the state of the cleanup state machine (read more about the cleanup state machine for further details). Since these states can change due to external events, you can call these as slots if you like. If you never require any cleanup, you can call setCleanedUp() in your constructor.
  - setAcquiring(), setAcquisitionSucceeded(), setAcquisitionFailed(), setCancelling(), setCancelled(), setReadyForAcquisition(), setNotReadyForAcquisition() You must call these functions to change the state of the acquisition state machine (read more about the acquisition state machine for further details). Since these states can change due to external events, you can call these as slots if you like.

  - setAutoSetInitializing(), setAutoSetCancelling(), setAutoSetCleaningUp() You must call these functions in your constructor if you wish to redefine the automatic behavior for emitting these signals. If you expect external events to always signal these events (whether you call them in Acquaman or whether they happen elsewhere) then you can emit all of the signals yourself by turning these off.
