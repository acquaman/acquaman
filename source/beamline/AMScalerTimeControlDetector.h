	The reason for this extention is because everything time based is in seconds throughout all of the equipment
	and also everywhere in AM.  Unfortunately, the scaler has it's time in milliseconds and if it was to be
	added into a scan, it would require a scaling by one thousand and that would add unnecessary clutter to
	the scan data.
