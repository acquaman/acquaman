/// AMActionInfo defines the interface for subclasses that describe actions (AMAction). The Info subclasses are a way to separate the description/content of actions from their implementation. This allows storing and viewing future/past actions inside programs which shouldn't have the capability to run them
/*! (For example: viewing a history of a user's SGM beamline actions inside their take-home Dataman program, or when on another beamline. Theoretically, this approach could even let someone plan and queue up beamline actions at home to run once they get to the beamline.)

  Normally there is a one-to-one mapping between AMAction and corresponding AMActionInfo classes.  The AMAction class is instantiated by passing an AMActionInfo into its constructor; while the action exists there is a "has-a" relationship between actions and infos.  The AMActionInfo should contain the parameters that specify the content of the action, but should not be coupled to the implementation; the AMAction class adds any necessary implementation objects.

  After actions are run, it is their AMActionInfo that can be stored persistently in the user's database [and hence shared across other beamlines/programs, which is why the infos must be decoupled from the implementation]. If you want to be able to re-create and run live AMActions based on these stored AMActionInfos, you should register your Action/Info pair with AMActionRegistry::registerActionForInfo().

All actions NEED to have a valid action info.  However, if you want to be lazy and dispense with the hassle of custom AMActionInfo subclasses, you can use an instance of the generic AMActionInfo inside your actions (for ex: where the action parameters have been hard-coded into the actions themselves). The information in this base class is sufficient to provide users with general feedback on the state of the action while it is queued or running.  However, in this case it will not be possible to recreate a copy of any particular action based on the stored AMActionInfo.

  A custom AMActionInfo is also necessary if you want to install a custom view or editor for queued or stored actions; this can be done using the AMActionRegistry functions registerDelegateForInfo(), registerEditorForInfo() and registerWindowEditorForInfo(). All of the views/editors operate on the info rather than the action, so that they can be used in programs that shouldn't/can't access the action's implementation.
