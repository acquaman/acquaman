/// An AMLoopAction contains a list of sub-actions that, when the loop action is run, will be executed a fixed number of times.  It implements the AMNestedAction interface so that the sub-actions are visible inside the AMActionRunner views, so that users can drag-and-drop existing actions into/out-of the loop.
/*! The sub-actions are effectively used as templates, because a new copy of each sub-action will be made every time it is executed. You can configure whether you want the entire loop action logged as one, or every sub-action to be logged individually, by calling setShouldLogSubActionsSeparately(). */
