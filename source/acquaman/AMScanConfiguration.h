/// An AMScanConfiguration is the abstract parent class of all scan configurations.
/*!
  The AMScanConfiguration class acts as the abstract parent class from which all scan configuration classes descend.
  Algorithmically, data acquisition has two distinct phases: configuring a scan and running a scan.
  Although the distinction may be subtle it is a key observation. This can be noted directly as a user could configure a scan that they never decided to run.
  Furthermore, programatically, there is a separation between what information needs to be collected to specify the particular scan to run and the way in which the scan is actually executed.
  That is, with proper interfacing, two different scanning libraries could perform the same scan - and collect, essentially, the same data - by using the same scan configuration.

  Additionally, there will be many scan configuration implementation classes. Each technique, on each beamline will require a different implementation.
  For example, one might consider the SGM and REIXS beamlines, where both are capable of doing absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and emission spectroscopy (XES).
  Therefore, there could be four implementation classes: SGM's XAS Scan Configuration, SGM's XES Scan Configuration, REIXS' XAS Scan Configuration, and REIXS' XES Scan Configuration.  For each kind of scan configuration, there is an associated kind of scan controller, which takes care of actually executing the scan according to the configuration's parameters (when it comes time to do so).  For example, REIXSXESScanConfigurations are executed by a REIXSXESScanController.  (See AMScanController for details.)


  A scan configuration needs to record configuration values but not move the controls in anyway; therefore, a copy of the beamline object or any other control is not sufficient.

  As AMScanConfiguration is the base class from which all other scan configuration classes are derived, only information common to all scan configurations is kept here.
  This class inherits AMDbObject so that it can easily be recorded to the database (for example: to record the user's scan parameters associated with a scan).

  To implement a scan configuration object that works within the acquisition system, you need to provide at least two virtual functions:
  - createCopy() returns a pointer to a newly-created copy of this scan configuration.  (It takes the role of a copy constructor, but is virtual so that our high-level classes can copy a scan configuration without knowing exactly what kind it is.)
  - createController() returns a pointer to a newly-created AMScanController that is appropriate for executing this scan configuration.

\note On Circular Coupling and programming practice:
The createController() function introduces a circular coupling: Configurations create their Controller, and Controllers have a Configuration that they execute.

In theory, these relationships should normally be avoided.  However, at this point in time, the Configuration is the only class that has exact knowledge of its type (and hence knows what type of Controller needs to be created), so it actually introduces the least external coupling if we do it here.  In practice, this coupling is not a problem, and works well, because we always expect a one-to-one relationship between Controller and Configuration types.  Eventually this could be removed by a registration system that links configuration types to controller types.)
