/// This class allows the building of a 2D map scan controller using the DACQ library.
/*!
	This extends the functionality of the single dacq scan controller by extending
	the capabilities to do scans over two independent axes.  There is a strict requirement
	that the map be rectangular and to enforce this there are two pure virtual functions
	that must be implemented by subclasses in order for the class to be instantiated.

	Currently, the fast and slow axis can be either the x-axis or y-axis.  The only assumption
	is that the order inside of the configuration file is:

		1) Slow axis
		2) Fast axis.

	This is important because the start implementation will set the control information based
	on that specification.  An important distinction is that the even if the fast and slow axes
	are switched, the order of the first two data sources are still x then y.

	Another assumption is that the first two data sources are assumed to be the x and y
	coordinates, respectively.  If anything else is in the first two columns then the
	data will not be stored correctly.  The remaining columns can be in any order.
