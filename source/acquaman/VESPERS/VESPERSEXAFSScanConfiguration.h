/// This class is the VESPERS specific EXAFS scan configuration.
/*!
	This class extends the AMEXAFSScanConfiguration to configure any kind
	of XAS scan for the VESPERS beamline.  It is an energy scan that can
	be configured to run over just the edge of a given element (XANES) or it
	can be configured to run over the entire range of a given edge (EXAFS).
	Both types of scans have some subtle differences between how the scans are
	setup and these are accommodated.  You have the flexibility to choose which
	ion chamber you wish to use for I0 and It (for transmission mode) and also
	the choice of fluorescence detector that the scan will use if collecting
	the partial fluorescence yield.  It saves the edge, the energy, and a position
	that the scan will move to in the event there are different hot spots that
	you want to queue up.
