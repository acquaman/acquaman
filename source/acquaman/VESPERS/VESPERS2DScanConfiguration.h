/// This class is the VESPERS specific 2D map scan configuration.
/*!
	This class extends AM2DScanConfiguration to configure 2D map scans for the
	VESPERS beamline.  These scans are spatial scans in both directions to perform
	an XRF map or an XRF + XRD map simulatenously.  The scan configuration for both
	types are the same because the XRD is handled inside of the configuration file
	that is loaded into AM2DDacqScanController and so the only thing that this
	configuration needs to do is know whether this scan needs to load in the configuration
	file with XRD or not.
