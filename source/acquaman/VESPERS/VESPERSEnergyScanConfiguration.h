/// This class is a VESPERS specific extension of a basic XAS scan configuration.
/*!
	Unlike a typical XAS scan, this scan configuration is not meant to reproduce
	scans in a XANES fashion.  It is meant to do crude energy scans over a large
	portion of the beamline's energy spectrum.  It is also primarily focused for
	use with the Roper CCD and (in the future) the MarCCD.  It is meant to automate
	the process of collecting a single image in a range such as:

		Start: 10 keV, Delta: 1 keV, End: 20 keV.

	Because of this, the fluorescence detectors are not a part of this scan type.
