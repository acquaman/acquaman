/// This class is the VESPERS specific spatial line scan configuration.
/*!
	This class extends the AMRegionsScanConfiguration to configure a scan
	using only one motor to move the sample translationally.  Currently,
	there are four choices of motor to use:

		- horizontally using the H pseudo motor
		- horizontally using the x real motor
		- vertically using the V pseudo motor
		- vertically using the z real motor.

	It then operates in exactly the same way as a 2D map, define a start
	point and end point with an appropriate delta.  It generates a pixmap
	with the number of pixels = 1.  All of the rest of the parameters set
	are the same as a 2D map.  It also has the ability to take CCD images
	at the same time (identical to the 2D map).
