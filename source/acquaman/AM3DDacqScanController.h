/// This class allows the building of a 3D map scan controller using the DACQ library.
/*!
	This extends the functionality of the single dacq scan controller by extending
	the capabilities to do scans over three independent axes.  There is a strict requirement
	that the map be a parallelpiped (rectangular in 3 dimensions) and to enforce this there are three pure virtual functions
	that must be implemented by subclasses in order for the class to be instantiated.

	Currently, the axes are issued priorities that can be either in any order.  The only assumption
	is that the order inside of the configuration file is the lower the priority, the slower that axis
	is changed.

	This is important because the start implementation will set the control information based
	on that specification.  An important distinction is that regardless of the priority order,
	the order of the first three data sources are still x then y then z.

	Another assumption is that the first three data sources are assumed to be the x, y, and z
	coordinates, respectively.  If anything else is in the first two columns then the
	data will not be stored correctly.  The remaining columns can be in any order.

	Because AM3DScanConfiguration was unable to subclass itself from AM2DScanConfiguration,
	it prevents AM3DDacqScanController from subclassing itself from AM2DDacqScanController.
	This requires a fair bit of code duplication, which is not ideal.
