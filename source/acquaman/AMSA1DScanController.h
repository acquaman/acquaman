/// Prototype of a 1-dimensional scan controller that steps through the regions defined in AMRegionScanConfiguration, using an AMControl for motion and an arbitrary set of detectors. Detectors need to implement the AMSADetector interface.
/*! This can be subclassed by re-implementing
- customInitializeImplementation(),
- customCleanupImplementation()
to do beamline-specific work prior to, and after, the scan runs.

-control(),
-currentPosition(), and
-currentAcquisitionTime()

can also be re-implemented; this might be sufficient to build an EXAFS scan controller with variable step sizes and acquisition (dwell) times.

This uses the CDF data store and file loader (AMCDFDataStore, AMCDFv1FileLoader), so you don't need to write a custom file loader plugin.
