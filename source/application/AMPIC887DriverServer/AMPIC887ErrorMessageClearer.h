/*!
  * \brief A helper class for use in the STP (stop) and HLT (halt smoothly) commands
  * to delay clearing the error message for some specified length of time. Call
  * start() passing a number of milliseconds to schedule clearning of the error
  * message to take place no earlier than the provided time.
  *
  * There appears to be a bug either in the PI_GCS2_DLL library, or with the controller
  * itself, which causes a command to be rejected (with a timeout error) if it is
  * issued before the axes have fully come to a stop. This causes problems because
  * both STP and HLT commands set the error state of the controller, and the library
  * is coded in such a way that commands always fail if an error code exists in
  * the controller. This means it is required for our STP and HLT implementations
  * to clear this error message as part of their procedure, or else the next issued
  * command will always fail. These two problems combine to mean that there needs
  * to be a set delay each time either command is called (in order to give the axes
  * time to come to a stand-still) before the error can be cleared. This class
  * exists to allow us to schedule this clearing of the error message after some
  * defined length of time.
  *
  * NOTE: Because this class has to outlive the command class which requires it,
  * it must be allocated on the heap. However in order to ensure that it does not
  * create a memory leak it must call deleteLater() on itself after clearing the
  * error message. As such creating a stack allocated instance of the class will
  * still cause deleteLater() to be called - resulting in undefined behaviour.
