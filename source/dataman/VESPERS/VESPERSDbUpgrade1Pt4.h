/// This class upgrades the database to use the new VESPERS::Motor enum.
/*!
	This database upgrade takes the two different motor choice enums in VESPERS2DScanConfiguration
	and VESPERSSpatialLineScanConfiguration and consolidates them to use the new
	enum that contains just individual motors that can be OR'ed together because
	they are setup in powers of two.  The steps are the same for both tables:

		1) Change the values in the table from the old enum to the new enum values.
		2) Change the name of the column to make it identical across scan configurations.
