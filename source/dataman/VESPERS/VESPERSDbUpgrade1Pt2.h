/// This class is a very simple database upgrade where the column name for fluorescenceDetectorChoice is renamed to fluorescenceDetector.
/*!
	Although the actual change is quite minor, the process is somewhat involved because SQLite doesn't have the entire SQL language
	options.  The other reason for this upgrade is for practice changing column names since the next database upgrade
	changes the contents of the columns as well as the name of the column.
