/// Construct an AMExportController to supervise exporting a set of AMScans from the user's database.  Used in conjunction with an AMExportWizard, the user will be given options of different exporters ("file formats") to choose from, and will be able to review the option/template for their chosen exporter.  Finally, a progress bar will be displayed as the scans are exported.
/*! <b>Steps to using AMExportController</b>
  - [If it hasn't been done yet] Register all the exporter classes you want to enable using the static registerExporter<>() template function.  (An exporter class is a subclass of AMExporter that is used to write a specific file format, usually with its own set of options).

  - Construct an export controller with the list of database URLs you want to export

  - Call setDestinationFolderPath() with the complete path to the folder where you want to put the exported data.

  - Call chooseExporter() using one of the exporter classes previously registered.  (See registeredExporters() for the ones available.)

  - Call setOption() with an instance of the exporter options to use.  (An option is a subclass of AMExporterOption, and tells the exporter how to write the file, what to include, etc.  There is usually a specific option subclass for each exporter subclass.)  The option provided should be compatible with the exporter.

  - Call startExport() to start writing the files.  You can monitor progress() and progressChanged(), as well as status() and statusChanged(), while the exporter is running.  You can also call cancel() to give up at the current point.

Note that creating an AMExportWizard on an export controller will handle all but the first two steps for you, through a user-driven GUI interface:
\code
AMExportController exportController(myListOfScansToExport);
AMExportWizard* wizard = new AMExportWizard(&exportController, parentWidget);
\endcode

However, you can also use the AMExportController API directly, without employing an AMExportWizard, by proceeding through all the steps above.
