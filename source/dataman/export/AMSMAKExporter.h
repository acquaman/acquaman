/*!
	This class extends the generic exporter to write the files in a way that can be
	read by SMAK, but also have all the information of the scan.  Because SMAK does
	not require much of the data to visualize there are two data files.  The first
	will be SMAK specific where all the necessary data is in place to be easily visualized.
	The second will be a data file identical to AMExporter2DAscii because it has
	all of the data in a nice format.  Finally, the spectra files will be in SMAK's
	format.

		- tab delimeted instead of comma
		- every row is prefaced with an index.
