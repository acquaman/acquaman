/*!
	This class extends the generic exporter to write the files in a way that is similar in style as the current dacq output.
	This is required because of the file names for the CCD images that can be a part of the scan.  Otherwise it could use the
	regular ascii exporter.

	Due to the simple extension to AMExporterGeneralAscii, VESPERSExporter2DAscii uses AMExporterOptionGeneralAscii for its
	exporter option.  It does not require anything in addition to that.

	It is important to note that this is used ONLY with VESPERS line scans because it needs some VESPERS specific knowledge.
	Not for general use.
