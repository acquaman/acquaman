/*!
 This class extends the generic exporter to write the files in a way that is similar in style as the current dacq output.
 This is puts all the data for the data sources in single columns, even though all the data sources inside of the maps are
 all 3D data.

 Due to the simple extension to AMExporterGeneralAscii, VESPERSExporter3DAscii uses AMExporterOptionGeneralAscii for its
 exporter option.  It does not require anything in addition to that.

 It is important to note that this is used ONLY with VESPERS 2D maps because it needs some VESPERS specific knowledge.
 Not for general use.
