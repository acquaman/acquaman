/// This class implements multi-dimensional storage of scan data, according to the AMDataStore interface.  All data is stored in memory, and accessing data values should be quite fast.
/*! <b>Memory Layout</b>
We need to provide a dense multi-dimensional scan space across scan axes, and at each point in that space, a set of multi-dimensional detector measurements (where each kind of measurement can have a different size).

Detector measurements are stored in a vector of AMNumbers, typedef'd as AMIMDSMeasurement.  For multi-dimensional measurements, the data is stored flattened, in row-major order (ie: the first measurement axis varies the slowest).

A vector of AMIMDSMeasurements makes up a single AMIMDSScanPoint.

Finally, a vector of AMIMDSScanPoints makes up the scan space.  Multi-dimensional scan spaces are also stored flattened, in row-major order.

With the exception of single detector blocks, the full data store is not stored contiguously, so datasets approaching the size of the full computer memory may be used, without requiring a single allocated chunk.


\note A previous version of AMInMemoryDataStore (up until commit f846098ca399b) used a hierarchical tree for storing the scan space, so that any scan axis could be extended on an already-populated data store. This version has been simplified based on the new restrictions in the AMDataStore API.
