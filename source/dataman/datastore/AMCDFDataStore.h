/// This class implements multi-dimensional storage of scan data, according to the AMDataStore interface.  It is optimized for scan data sets that are too large to store completely in memory.  Data is stored on disk in a CDF formatted file, but accessing the values should be reasonably fast thanks to reading and caching of chunks at a time.  Like AMInMemoryDataStore, using the values() method to access data is much faster than reading by individual value().
/*!  <b>CDF Layout</b>

  We use the following CDF layout to represent the AMDataStore scan space / measurement space concept:

  Measurements:
  =============

  One CDF "zVariable" is created for each measurement.  The name of the CDF variable is the same as the name of the AMDataStore measurement.  The CDF provides native support for multi-dimensional variables, so a single multi-dimensional measurement reading can be stored in one record of a CDF variable.  The CDF library remembers the rank and size of the measurement.

  One CDF "record" is used to represent a single point in scan space.  For a scalar scan space, there exists only a single record in the file.  For a multi-dimensional scan space, the scan points are stored by records in row major order (the first scan index varies the slowest; the last scan index varies the fastest).  For example, for a 2D scan with 3 x 3 points, there will be 9 records: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1)... stored for each variable.

  One other set of CDF zVariables is created: for each scan axis that has non-uniform independent axisValue()s, there is a scalar measurement with the special name "AxisValues::[axisName]".  Each record stores a single axis value.

  Attributes:
  ===========

  The above measurements are sufficient to hold all the raw data in memory, but depend on the AMAxisInfo and AMMeasurementInfo in-memory structures to describe the structure and meaning of that raw data. Therefore, AMCDFDataStore also creates additional CDF "attributes" to make the CDF file self-documenting; this means that a pre-existing CDF file with those attributes can be used to completely instantiate an AMCDFDataStore.  These attributes are only used by instantiateFromExistingFile().
