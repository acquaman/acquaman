/// The AMDataStore defines an interface for various implementations which store multi-dimensional experimental data (either in memory, or to disk).
/*! <b>Concepts and terminology:<b>

  A 'detector' is a device that can record a (possibly multi-dimensional) measurement. [ex: scalar intensity value, 1D spectrum, or 2D image, etc.]
  A 'measurement' is a single instance of a reading by a detector.

  A 'scan' is sequence of measurements, conducted over a (possibly multi-dimensional) space.  For every scan point, a measurement is recorded for each detector. [ex: 1D XAS scan over incident energy, 2D microprobe scan over a sample's surface, 3D scan combining microprobe with XAS, etc.]

  A 'value' is a scalar number, which can be specified completely with:
	- a detector ID (which detector?)
	- a complete set of indexes into the scan space (where in the scan?)
	- AND a complete set of indexes into the measurement dimensions

  <b>Datastore Assumptions and Restrictions</b>

  - The data store is organized to support a set of (one or more) detectors.  A measurement for ALL detectors must be stored for EACH scan point.
  - The scan space is regular and complete (not sparse). The size of other scan dimensions does not vary as a function of any scan dimension. (If certain points in the scan space are not measured, they should return null values.)
  - Every measurement by the same detector has the same dimensionality.

Two more restrictions were added after commit f846098ca399b:
  - The length of the first scan axis is originally 0, and can be extended by inserting or appending using beginInsertRows()/endInsertRows(). However, the length of all additional scan axes must be specified at the time they are defined with addScanAxis(), and cannot be changed later.
- Additionally, you cannot add additional scan axes (using addScanAxis()) after rows and data points have been inserted.

[These restrictions were added to allow good performance and simple implementations for disk-based data stores that employ contiguous multi-dimensional array storage; it is only possible to append to their slowest-changing array dimension. Any other operations require inserting entries between each existing entry, which would require copying all records of a (possibly very large) data set.]


  <b>API Terminology Clarification</b>
  Within the AMDataStore interface, we avoid talking about detectors (since they have nothing to do with storage). The functions that refer to 'measurements' in the API are actually referring to 'measurement classes' instead of single measurements (effectively, 'detectors' according to the terminology above).  For example, addMeasurement() is used to create space to store an additional measurement <i>for every scan point</i>... To match the terminology above, we should have said 'addDetector()' instead.

	/////////////////////////////
	/// Create space to support an (additional) scan axis.  \c axisDetails describes the characteristics of the axis, but if this is the first axis to be added, the \c axisDetails.size will be set to 0.  All subsequent axes must specify their final size (>0), and this size cannot be changed later. (ie: Only the first axis can be extended via beginInsertRows()).  Note that it is also impossible to add scan axes after rows have already been added with beginInsertRows(); in that case, this function should return false.
	/*! These restrictions are in place to simplify behaviour and increase performance for implementations.

If you want to retrieve axes by name, \c axisDetails must contain a unique \c name.  This function should return false if an axis with that name already exists.

	  \note No signalling is provided for alerting observers of new scan axes. It's also prohibited for AMDataSources that expose this data (for ex: AMRawDataSource) to change dimensionality (ie: add another axis). Therefore, it's recommended to only call this function when first setting up a dataStore, before any observers get involved.
