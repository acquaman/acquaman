/*! <b>Introduction to the AMDbObject persistent object system</b>

The AMDbObject system provides a way to make QObjects persistent, ie: storable and reloadable from a permanent database.  It is highly integrated with the Qt meta object system. Some of the features that set it apart from other C++ ORM (Object-Relational Management) systems:

- More than one database is supported: objects can be loaded out of one database, and stored into another.
- No special syntax or external files are required to specify which member variables should be persistent (the  "data definition model"), or create the database tables. The fields you wish to store can be identified within the class definition by simply declaring then as QProperties with the Q_PROPERTY macro.  Calling AMDbObjectSystem::registerType<Class>() will register the class and create the tables if required.
- Dynamic loading of an object, without knowing its type. You can call AMDbObjectSystem::loadObject() and receive a fully-initialized pointer to whatever object was stored at the specified location.
- Objects of different classes can share a storage table, if desired. At the expense of having unused/null columns, this can make searching the database for similar objects much easier.
- The database can still be accessed using raw SQL. This has the drawback of allowing stored objects to be modified without control, but it allows for high-performance searching and updates when required.
- Explicit support is provided for composition of AMDbObject subclasses: a class which contains members which are AMDbObjects can reload them automatically as it is loaded from the database.
- \todo Explicit support for One-to-one, many-to-one and one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships


<b>Database layout of AMDbObjects</b>

In most cases, all objects of a certain class are stored in their own table. The table has columns for each member variable.  Objects are uniquely identified by their row (primary key), which can be retrieved with AMDbObject::id().

The types of member variables which may be stored are:

	- Integers
	- Floating point numbers
	- QStrings
	- QDates, QTimes, and QDateTimes
	- Any other QVariant types will attempt to be stored as strings, using the toString() and fromString() operations.

List member variables (specifically, QStringList, AMIntList, and AMDoubleList) can be stored within a single table cell. (Defined separators are used to combine the list values into a string representation, and extract them back again.) More complex lists require special handling, and sometimes a separate table.

If specified, classes can share a database table with other classes. They do this by specifying the class name of an already-registered class whose table they want to share.

<b>Creating a persistent class definition</b>

To add persistent functionality to your class:

- Inherit from AMDbObject, and declare the Q_OBJECT macro.
- Declare properties (using the Q_PROPERTY) macro for all the fields you want to be persistent. Fields with only a READ method will stored in the database, but not reloaded from it. The name of the property becomes the name of the database column.
	\bug This introduces some restrictions on the allowed property names -- find a way to catch this! for ex: "value" is not allowed as a property name.

- You can use the Q_CLASSINFO macro to specify additional characteristics for each field, in the form of semicolon-separated 'key=value' pairs:
\code
Q_CLASSINFO("propertyName", "keyword1=value1;keyword2=value2;keyword3=value3...")
\endcode
	where supported keywords are:
	- \c doNotStore: if equal to "true", does not store this property in the database. (Also implies doNotLoad=true)
	- \c doNotLoad: if equal to "true", does not set this property when re-loading an object from the database.
	- \c hidden: if equal to "true", this property should not be user-visible in default tables created on the database.
	- \c createIndex: if equal to "true", creates an index on this column in the table. (You should understand the performance implications of doing this. In short, it will make searches based on this column's values much faster, but slow down inserts and deletes, and take extra space in the database.

	If unspecified, the default value for all keywords is false. Note that subclasses inherit the base class definitions, unless re-defined.

- You can use the Q_CLASSINFO macro to specify characteristics for the entire object, also in the form of semicolon-separated 'key=value' pairs:
\code
Q_CLASSINFO("AMDbObject_Attributes", "keyword1=value1;keyword2=value2;...")
\endcode
	where the supported keywords are:
	- \c description: if provided, gives a human-readable string description for this class. (ex: "XRay Absorption Scan").
	- \c version: if provided, gives the version number (integer) of this class, for the purpose of software upgrades. [This is currently unused, but might be in the future].  If not specified, the default version is 1.  If you upgrade a class for which users have existing stored objects in their database, increase the version number (> 1), so that existing databases know that they must be upgraded.  One problem: up'ing the version number of a base class may or may not up the version number of a subclass, depending on whether the subclass re-defines the AMDbObject_Attributes class info. Therefore, this version number is currently unused; we use a different upgrade technique for now.
	- \c doNotReuseIds: if equal to "true", the auto-increment property on the primary key will be set so that new objects will never reuse the ids of old deleted ones.  Otherwise, after a table has had rows created and deleted, the ids of previously deleted rows may be re-used.
	- \c shareTableWithClass=[\c className]: if defined, uses the same database table for storage as [\c className].  Note that [\c className] must be registered with the AMDbObject system prior to registering this class.

	Note that subclasses inherit the base class definition for the whole attribute string, unless re-defined.  You can only specify the AMDbObject_Attributes once per class; multiple Q_CLASSINFO definitions are not allowed.


- Register the class with the system by calling AMDbObjectSupport::s()->registerClass<Class>() at runtime.  It's harmless to register a class multiple times, but it must be registered before calling storeToDb() or loadFromDb().
\code
AMDatabase* myWorkingDatabase;
// The following two lines can be done in either order:
AMDbObjectSupport::s()->registerDatabase(myWorkingDatabase);
AMDbObjectSupport::s()->registerClass<MyDbObject>();
\endcode

- Finally, all database objects have the optional functionality of providing one or more thumbnails to describe themselves. If you want to have non-blank thumbnails, you must provide thumbnailCount() and thumbnail(int index). The default is to have no thumbnails.

<b>Storing and re-loading persistent objects</b>

To store an AMDbObject in a database, simply call
\code
AMDatabase* myWorkingDatabase;
MyDbObject bob;
bob.setSomeProperty("foo");

bob.storeToDb(myWorkingDatabase);
\endcode
If the object has previously been stored in or loaded from the given database, it will have a valid id(), and be re-saved in the same location (sql UPDATE).  If the object has never been stored in a database before (id() < 1), or has been loaded from a different database (database() != the given database), then it will be added as a new object (sql INSERT).

You can restore an object from the database (ie: copy its values from the stored version to the in-memory object) by calling
\code
MyDbObject bob;
bob.loadFromDb(myWorkingDatabase, id);
\endcode
where \c id is the row to load the object from.

If you want to reload an object from the database, but you don't know its exact detailed type, you can use the dynamic loader. It will create and loadFromDb() the appropriate object for a given database, id, and table name:
\code
AMDbObject* newSomeKindaObject = AMDbObjectSupport::s()->createAndLoadObjectAt(myWorkingDatabase, tableName, id);
\endcode
You can then use qobject_cast<>() or type() to test the type of the newly-created object.

\note This functionality depends on the detailed class providing either a default constructor that requires no arguments, or a constructor that accepts a database and id:

\code
Q_INVOKABLE MyDbObject(AMDatabase* db, int id);
\endcode

 In either case, the constructor must be declared with the Q_INVOKABLE flag. It's recommended that all AMDbObjects provide one or another of these constructors.

\todo how to re-implement the modified() and metaDataChanged() signal, now that we're using the property system, instead of setMetaData()?


<b>Composition of AMDbObjects</b>

Special handling of two property types provides support for composite AMDbObjects that "own" or "have" other AMDbObjects as member variables.  (Note that this functionality is provided for ownership situations only; it is distinct from the concept of association (ex: one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, such as between Scans and Experiments).  The distinction here is that a scan object does not 'own' all of the experiments it is part of, nor does an experiment 'own' all the scans it contains. Association relationships must be handled separately.)

To automatically store AMDbObject member variables, declare a Q_PROPERTY of the type AMDbObject*.  The read function should simply return a pointer to your member object.

When you call storeToDb() on the parent object,
- the read property is used to access a pointer to the member object. If the pointer is not 0, and the object has been modified(), we call storeToDb() on the member object as well.  Then we store the table name and storage id of the member object, so that it can be reloaded later.

Calling loadFromDb() could behave in two different ways:
	- The read property is used again to access a pointer to the member object. If it receives a valid pointer, and the type() of the existing object matches the type of the stored object, we call loadFromDb() on the existing object. setProperty() is never called.
	- If the read property returns a null pointer, or if the type() of the existing object does NOT match the type of the object stored in the database, we cannot call loadFromDb().  Instead, we create a brand new object using AMDbObjectSupport::s()->createAndLoadObjectAt() based on the stored object. Then we call setProperty() with a pointer to the newly created object.  (Note that if createAndLoadObjectAt() fails, setProperty() will pass in a null pointer, and you should check for this.)  \note It's the responsibility of the setProperty() write function to delete the old existing object (if required), take ownership of the new object, and re-connect any signal/slot connections to the newly created object.

	In normal usage, where the type of the member AMDbObject is constant, the second version of the loadFromDb() behaviour will only occur when re-loading the parent object from the database for the first time (if the member object hasn't been created by the constructor, and the read property returns a null pointer). In all subsequent storeToDb()/loadFromDb() calls, the existing member object will simply be stored and loaded transparently with the parent.


To store sets of AMDbObject member variables, you can declare a Q_PROPERTY of the type AMDbObjectList (ie: QList<AMDbObject*>).  The read function should return a list of pointers to your member objects.

storeToDb() and loadFromDb() work the same as in the case of single variables.
	- The read property is used to access a list of pointers to member objects. Each valid object is storeToDb()'d, and the table and id locations for each are stored with the parent object for future reference. (Here we use an auxilliary table called 'MainTableName_propertyName' to remember the stored locations.)

	- loadFromDb() also starts by calling the read property function to get a list of the existing member objects.  If the number of existing objects matches the number of stored objects, AND all the existing objects are valid, AND the types match for all pairs of (existing,stored) objects, then loadFromDb() is called on each.
	- Otherwise, if there are any discrepencies, a whole new set of objects is created with AMDbObjectSupport::s()->createAndLoadObjectAt() based on the stored versions, and setProperty() is called with the list of new objects.  (Note that if createAndLoadObjectAt() fails, there may be null pointers in this list.)  It's the responsibility of the setPropert() write function to delete the old existing objects (if required) and re-establish connections to the new objects.   Note that it is NOT possible to reuse some of the existing objects in the list, but not others.
