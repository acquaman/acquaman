/// This class provides thread-safe, general access to an SQL database.
/*! Instances of this class are used to query or modify a database; all of the functions are thread-safe and will operate using a per-thread connection to the same underlying database.

	Access to instances is organized using a "multiton" approach: to create a new instance, use the static AMDatabase::createDatabase() function and include a connection name.  Later, access to the instance can be retrieved using the same connection name with the static AMDatabase::database() function. This ensures unique connection names across the entire program.

	Once you have an instance, you can query, insert rows, create tables, etc. using query(), insertOrUpdate(), update(), retrieve(), ensureTable(), deleteRow(), etc. All of these are thread-safe and can be called from any thread.

	\note Regarding related classes AMDbObject and AMDbObjectSupport: this class only provides tools for accessing and working with an arbitrary SQL database; no specific schema or meaning is implied.  The actual schema -- or table structure -- for an Acquaman user database is defined dynamically by the AMDbObject classes and AMDbObjectSupport.  The objective of this class is just to cleanly encapsulate the useful SQL queries, and protect the database integrity by reducing the amount of times anyone requires direct access to run arbitrary queries.
