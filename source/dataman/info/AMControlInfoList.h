/// This is a container class for AMControlInfo, most commonly used to represent an arbitrary set of control positions.  It is an AMDbObject subclass that can be stored to the database, but it's also a lightweight class that can be copied and passed around by value.
/*! Note that the assignment operator and copy constructor copy the other object's <i>database identity</i> as well as its values; these are a "shallow copy" from the perspective of the database: both source and destination will point to the same location in the database, although they are separate objects in C++ memory. If you want to copy all the values from another AMControlInfoList, but preserve your database identity, use setValuesFrom() instead. For more information, see setValuesFrom(). */
