/**
 * A class representing an extension of QSortFilterProxyModel which adds:
 * - The ability to add a single 'top level' filter which is applied above whatever standard filter
 *   is applied to the model. This is currently set with setRunId(int) and setExperimentId(int), which
 *   will first filter by run/experiment, and then by whatever other filter has been applied. Note that
 *   only one of these can be set at once.
 * - The ability to search for 'data source' which is a field of the second level of the hierarchical
 *   source model. This is achieved by hardcoding this field as filterKeyColumn() number 8.
