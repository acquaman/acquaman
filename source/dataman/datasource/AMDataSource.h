However, to allow ANY object to observe an AMDataSource, we implement this pattern using signals (signalSource()'s valuesChanged(), sizeChanged(), axisInfoChanged(), etc.).  Still, in some cases its important to know if other objects are depending on this data source for values.  This function allows an object to register a long-term interest in this data source.  You can call observerCount() to find out how many observers a data source has.  Call deregisterObserver() to release this interest.

	  Calling registerObserver() twice with the same object does nothing on the second time.

	  \note By convention, plots and views do not normally register as observers even though they display an AMDataSource's values. However, other data sources and analysis blocks that absolutely require access to this object's data MUST register.
