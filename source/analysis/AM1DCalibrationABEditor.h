  This is a view that contains a drop box that holds all of the available data sources for normalization, energy offest ans caling values, and an adjustable origin point to scale about.  Any changes to these values are automatically propigated to all other AM1DCalibration analysis blocks applied to the sampel scan.  Includes option to apply this set of calibration values to other scans.

  \todo Because of the dynamic nature of setting various data sources, the AMDataSource API will need to have a general capability for choosing data sources like this (or in some other way).  That way some of these views can be generalized rather than making a specific one for every analysis block.
