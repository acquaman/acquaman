  This is a very basic view that contains a drop box that holds all of the available data sources for normalization.

  \todo Because of the dynamic nature of setting various data sources, the AMDataSource API will need to have a general capability for choosing data sources like this (or in some other way).  That way some of these views can be generalized rather than making a specific one for every analysis block.
