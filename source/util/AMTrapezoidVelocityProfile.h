 * \brief A class which represents the velocity profile of a some motion which

 * at the initialAcceleration towards some target velocity; when it reached the
 * point at which it must decelerate to return to the base velocity by the end
 * of the motion changing velocity at the rate defined by returnAcceleration it
 * will begin its deceleration.
 * NOTE 1: If the time of the motion is not sufficient to accelerate up to the
 * target velocity, the profile will resemble a triangle, rather than a trapezoid.
