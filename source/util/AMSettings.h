/// This class encapsulates user settings/options that are persistent over many runs of the program.  Now that we have a database system for persistent data, only the essential information required to get to the database is stored in here. (See AMUser for the rest of the user's settings.)
/*!
   User-specific settings are stored under the AMUserSettings class.  They can be different for each user account.


	AMSettings are loaded from config. files by calling
   load(), and pushed out to the file with save().  Load() is normally called on program startup, and save() when the AMSettings view gets hit with OK or Apply (\todo... Make an AMSettings view).

   Accessing an option variable is simple and easy:
		AMUserAMSettings::userDataFolder or AMSettings::s()->publicDatabaseFilename(), etc.


   For user settings, only two basic pieces of information are stored in the config file: the folder to store the user's data and database, and the name of their database file.  Once we have this information, we can access the user's personal meta-data object, which is stored in the database itself. (see AMUser::user() for more information.)

	Storage locations: on Mac OS X, storage is at:
		- /Library/Preferences/Qt/Acquaman/Acquaman.ini for system-wide stuff
		- ~/.config/Acquaman/Acquaman.ini for user-specific

	On linux, storage is at:
		- /etc/xdg/Acquaman/Acquaman.ini (system-wide)
		- /home/user/.config/Acquaman/Acquaman.ini (user-specific)
