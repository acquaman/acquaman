/*! The standard QDialog signals are provided: finished(int result), and either accepted() or rejected().  After receiving these signals [or, after exec() finishes, if using this as a modal dialog], you can use getSelectedScans() to see what the user selected.

   \note It is recommended to use this as a modeless dialog, although it will work as a window-modal or application-modal dialog.  The QA_DeleteOnClose widget attribute is turned OFF by default, so that the dialog will not be deleted automatically when the user dismisses it.  This allows you to call getSelectedScans() after the dialog has been closed.  For more information on using modal and modeless dialogs, see the QDialog documentation.
