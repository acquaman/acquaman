	/*! HeightForWidth mode means that the item's preferred height (returned via QGraphicsLayoutItem::sizeHint()) depends on the width available. (For example, a paragraph of wrapping text, or an image with a constant aspect ratio.)  It _should_ be activated by doing a setSizePolicy() on the item, where the size policy object has had setHeightForWidth(true) called on it.  When heightForWidth is set, layouts should always provide a width constraint when calling sizeHint(), but they don't.

	(In Qt 4.7.1, they do, but it breaks spanning in row layouts. In Qt 4.7.2, it's "fixed", but layout performance is terrible, taking a minute or more with nested layouts.  See http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-12835 and http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-15333).

	This is our workaround for the time-being.  Do not setHeightForWidth(true) on the QGraphicsLayoutItem's sizePolicy().  Instead, call setWidthConstraint() on all the items in the top-level layout.  This causes them to re-calculate their sizeHints(), after which they should call updateGeometry(), posting a bunch of LayoutRequest events that will be gathered into one overall re-layout of the master layout.

/// This class implements a supremely awesome view of all the scan data found that can be found in a given database.  It can show scans from just one run, or just one experiment, or all runs or all experiments.  Beyond that, it can organize its data into sections based on the run, experiment, sample, element, or scan type.
/*! Implementation note: this class  acts as a QGraphicsView container, and a controller for AMDataViewSections and the specialized views employed by them.

The container functionality consists of a QGraphicsView, holding a QGraphicsScene with one top-level QGraphicsWidget. That internal QGraphicsWidget is resized in width whenever the AMDataView widget is resized, so that contained views may expand or shrink in height but always fill the width exactly. Only a vertical scroll bar is needed to scroll through the data.

The controller functionality consists of responding to signals from the OrganizeMode combo box, and the showRun(), showExperiment(), setOrganizeMode(), and setViewMode() slots.  When this happens, the database is queried for the  information corresponding to the view requested, and AMDataViewSection views for each section are created to show the actual data representation.

Some careful programmers will suggest that the controller functionality and view functionality (especially the QGraphicsView/resizing widget system) should be split into separate classes. All the power to you ; )

Last of all, this class emits the selectionChanged() and selectionActivated(QList<QUrl>) signals, to notify you when the user has selected or attempted to open a set of scans/objects. The format of the QUrls is the same as used for drag and drop events:
- amd://databaseConnectionName/tableName/objectId
