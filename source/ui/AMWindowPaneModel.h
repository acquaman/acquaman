/// The AMWindowPaneModel manages a collection of window panes used by the application's AMMainWindow. The panes can be docked and undocked from the main window, and the model can also be used to configure properties like the window titles and icons.

/*! Any QStandardItems (or subclasses of QStandardItems) can be used as items, as long as they don't have conflicting uses for the following data roles.

The following roles are used to access/represent/modify the state of the window panes:

- Qt::DisplayRole: (QString) Window title (corresponding to QWidget::windowTitle()).  This will change dynamically when the widget's title is changed using the normal QWidget API.  Calling setData() with this role has the same effect as calling QWidget::setWindowTitle().

- Qt::DecorationRole: (QIcon) Window icon (corresponding to QWidget::windowIcon()). This will change dynamically when the widget's icon is set using the normal QWidget API.  Calling setData() with this role has the same effect as calling QWidget::setWindowIcon(). The window icon is also used when displaying a list of window panes in the sidebar.

- AMWindowPaneModel::DockStateRole: (bool) true if the widget is docked in the main window; false if it has been undocked and is currently floating loose.

- AM::CanCloseRole: (bool) true if the widget can be permanently closed (ie: removed completely from the user interface) by the user.  Closeable windows will display a small 'x' in the sidebar view, which can be activated by the user.  Attempting to "close" a non-closeable window simply docks it back into the main window.

- AM::WidgetRole: (QWidget*) Access a pointer to the actual window pane widget

- AMWindowPaneModel::IsHeadingRole: (bool) Some entries in this model are just "Headings": titles for groups of window panes. This role returns true for all these items. \note This role is read-only; it simply indicates that the item has no QWidget* set for its AM::WidgetRole, nor is it an alias item.

- AMWindowPaneModel::IsAliasRole: (bool) "Aliases" are items that don't have their own unique window pane widgets, but instead link to another existing widget. When activated, they can deliver a message (in the form of a key-value pair) for that widget.  (For example, "Run" and "Experiment" items are shown in the Acquaman and Dataman sidebars, but all of these items are just aliases for a single AMDataView widget window pane.)  Whether an item is, in effect, an alias, is stored in this data role.

- AMWindowPaneModel::AliasTargetRole: (QStandardItem*) For alias items, this is the model item representing the "real" widget. \note It's important to never delete the "real" item while alias items for it still exist.  For now, this responsibility is up to the user. (For example, do not remove the AMDataView widget/window pane item, as long as runs and experiments are listed in the model.)

- AMWindowPaneModel::AliasKeyRole: (QString) For alias items, this is the "key" that can be used to figure out what the "real" widget should display when the alias item is activated. For example, AMDataView assumes it's either QString("run") or QString("experiment"), corresponding to the AMWindowPaneModel::AliasValueRole.

- AMWindowPaneModel::AliasValueRole: (QVariant) For alias items, this the "value" that can be used to figure out what the "real" window pane should display when the alias item is activated.  For example, AMDataView assumes it's the integer \c runId or \c experimentId of a run or experiment item.

<b>Inserting Window Pane Widgets</b>

You can insert a window pane widget using the addPane() convenience function.  This will create a new item in the model with the AM::WidgetRole set for the given widget.  Alternatively, you can create any subclass of QStandardItem, set its AM::WidgetRole (or alias roles) to point to your window pane widget manually, and then add it to the model.  The model is designed so that consistency is maintained across

- access through the model (ex: setData(), addRow(), etc.),
- or through the convenience functions (ex: addPane()),
- or through other APIs (ex: calling setWindowTitle() on a widget).

This allows a lot of flexibility in how the model is accessed, used, and extended.

<b>Drag and Drop</b>
The model can support item-specific decisions on "Drag and Drop" drop events. To accept drops, use a custom subclass of AMDragDropItem for your item class.
