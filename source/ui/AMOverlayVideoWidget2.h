/// Ever wanted to draw on top of live video? This is a convenience class that provides a QMediaPlayer, and a QGraphicsVideoItem embedded  inside a QGraphicsScene, so that other QGraphicsItems can be painted on top of it.
/*! The class itself is a QGraphicsView widget, and it creates the following objects automatically for you:

  - a QGraphicsScene to display all the visual stuff. (Access this via scene() to add more items.)
  - a QGraphicsVideoItem that actually renders the video.
  - a QMediaPlayer to load and control the video. Access this (for example, to set the URL of the video to play using setMedia()) via mediaPlayer().

  <b>Resizing</b>

  When this widget is resized, the scene inside the view it will be resized to keep the same size as the whole widget.  The internal video item will also be resized to fill the entire scene.
