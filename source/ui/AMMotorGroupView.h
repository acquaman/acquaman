/*!
	This widget has two viewing modes:  Single and Multiple.
	The idea for this is that there may be cases where you only want to have
	access to a single motor group object and there are times when you want
	to show multiple at once.  To help facilitate that there are two different
	basic views.

	For Exclusive view, the title is actually a combo box where your selection dictates
	which single view will be visible.  The right click menu will be considerably
	smaller, containing only the ability to switch between modes.  There is a
	convenience getter for "current view" that can return which view is currently
	being viewed.  It will also emit a signal too this effect.

	For Multiple view, the title is a standard label, but now the right click menu
	contains all of the possible motor group objects that can be viewed.  If a particular
	object is visible then the item will be checked off inside the list.  If any view
	is to be hidden again, selecting that option again will suffice.  This view has
	some convenience getters by returning the names or motor group objects of all
	visible motor group objects.

	\note The convenience getters will return default, null, or empty values when
	not in the mode of which they pertain.
