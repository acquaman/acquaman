Acquaman: Beamline ACQUisition And data MANagement

Feature Roadmap: July 2010
Mark Boots, David Chevrier
===========================


beta1: Sept 1, 2010
====================

Acquisition
=============
- Beamline status quick-view (energy; light-on/light-off button and feedback; detector feedback: got signal(s)?)
- Flux and resolution control (science-based information for monochromator and ID setup: controls grating, slit, ID harmonic, polarization; on REIXS: also spectrometer grating and slit as well)
- Detector Configurations: TEY (dwell time), TFY (HV), SDD, XEOL, XES (low/hi-res mode, detector angle)

- Sample Transfer walk-through
- Sample management: 
	- sample plates and memorized positions
	- memorized samples associated with scans
- Sample positioning:
	- memorized positions for a sample on a sample plate
	- video feedback with cross-hair (movable; not made out of scotch tape)
	- XES position optimization (automatically aligns for highest detector signal)
	
- Scan Setup: XAS
- Scan Setup: XES
- Scan Setup: Wizard mode

Visualization
============
- Plots, allowing:
	- comparison of scans to other scans
	- focus on different channels as desired: tey, tfy, (normalized/unnormalized), comparison with I0, etc.
- titles and legends on plots
- adjust line/color/style of plot series
- adjust waterfall and scaling on plots
- configure channels and arbitrary math expressions for each scan

Data Management
===============
- Supported scan types: XAS Scan, XES Scan
- scan editors: 2 specialized editors for XAS and XES
- Data browser: 
	- view by: table, table+thumbnail, and thumbnail view
	- Group scans by: Run (when taken at facility), Experiment (free for user create/add; analogy is playlist or photo album)
	- Organize by: date (header: Runs), scan type, sample, experiment, and arbitrary column
- external import and export tools
	- import: support existing file formats: SGM XAS, ALS XAS, ALS XES, general ascii columns	(auto-identify?)
		ascii import: skip 'n' first lines, specify delimeters (preview?); prompt for missing meta-data. [must work in batch mode for large set of files]
	- export: as ascii, .xls, and origin file formats. (choose channels & raw data columns to export; remember user-default settings)
	
- database storage and internal-data loaders for all scan types


beta1.01: Extra features, hopefully included in b1
===================================================
- Periodic table with edge information (Use to start a coarse or fine scan)
- Excel and Origin export: export channels as math formulas, not values
- Channels: access data from other scans
- Additional math functions in channel expressions (not strictly point-based: integration, differentiation, smoothing ...)
- Drag-and-drop other scans into plots (show: recent scans, specific run, specific sample, specific experiment)


b1.1
===============================
- Scription framework and user interface (script console, debugger, etc.)
- General queue system (integrated with user workflow system)
- Logbook (combine drag-and-dropped plot layouts with free notes and sketches)
- Calibration tools
- User-addable metadata
- Improved 2D data handling: UI for slicing, cross-sectioning, and joining a series of 1D datasets into a 2D set
- Native import handling for data files from PGM, HXMA, ...
	- Auto-import based on user account info?
- Multi-user database (online): enables sharing data with group members, collaborators, and public (if user chooses)
- Calibration standards (in public database). Linked from periodic table: is this what my data should look like?


b1.2
================================
- Refining scan ranges and re-starting new scans from within plot views
- Integration with modeling and fitting tools (Athena/Artemis, IFFEFFIT/FEFF, FitIt/FDMNES, Crystal Field/Atomic Multiplet, etc.)
- Advanced plot tools: view integrated area under a curve, peak fitting, centroid finding, ...
- Sample chamber and beam 3D modeling: automatic beam cross-hair on sample video
- Raster scanning and mapping support
- Continuous sample motion for radiation-damage-sensitive samples
